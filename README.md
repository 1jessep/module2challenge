# module2challenge

Hi my name is Jessep and this is my Module 2 Challenge.

Students were asked to create a fully functional/responsive Portfolio/Webpage showcasing html and css knowledge as well as best practices.

My notes can be found in the 'style.css' file. 


This is a screenshot of the desktop version of the webpage.
